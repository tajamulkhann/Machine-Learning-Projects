# AI Agent Trace Pattern Mining

Cluster agent runs by tool use, latency, token consumption, and recovery behavior to identify operational patterns.

## Project status

- **Portfolio decision:** New
- **Learning type:** Unsupervised learning
- **Core method:** K-Means and agglomerative clustering with robust scaling and PCA
- **Execution:** Notebook executed successfully with outputs committed

## Problem statement

The project demonstrates how patterns, similarities, communities, or anomalies can be discovered without using a prediction target during model fitting. Results are interpreted as exploratory signals rather than ground truth.

## Dataset

A deterministic domain-shaped numeric dataset is generated inside the notebook. Hidden generator profiles are used only for post-hoc diagnostics.

The notebook documents its data contract, reproducible seed, quality checks, and any synthetic proxy labels used only for retrospective diagnostics.

## Workflow

```text
Data validation
      ↓
Feature representation and scaling
      ↓
Unsupervised model comparison
      ↓
Internal metrics and stability checks
      ↓
Interpretation, visualization, and limitations
```

## Evaluation

The notebook uses method-appropriate evidence such as silhouette score, Davies-Bouldin index, cluster stability, retrieval similarity, graph structure, anomaly-score diagnostics, and post-hoc synthetic checks. No demo result is presented as a production benchmark.

## How to run

From the repository root:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r "Unsupervised Learning Projects/requirements.txt"
jupyter lab "Unsupervised Learning Projects/AI Agent Trace Pattern Mining/ai_agent_trace_pattern_mining.ipynb"
```

Run the notebook from top to bottom. Saved outputs are included for review.

## Technologies

- Python
- Pandas and NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Jupyter

## Responsible use

Discovered groups and anomaly flags do not establish identity, intent, causality, risk, or business impact. Production use requires domain review, representative data, privacy controls, monitoring, and decision-specific evaluation.
